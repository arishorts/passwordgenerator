# Password Generator

## Description

I want an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. This app will run in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. With it's deployment, I've learned a number of skills including:

### Javascript:

- Operators
- Control flow
- Objects
- Arrays
- Functions
